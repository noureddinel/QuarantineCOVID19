# QuarantineCOVID19
This Android app allows to monitor if your device is inside or outside a geofencing area (quarantine area), to be used to enforce COVID-19 lockdown.

## How it works?
The application uses WiFi APs and cellular signals to define a geofencing area (quarantine area). The app keeps scanning and monitoring the surrounding WiFi and cellular signals to determine if the device is still within the previously defined quarantine area or has left.
